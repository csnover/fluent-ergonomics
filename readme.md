# Fluent-Ergonomics

This is a short-term wrapper around the [Fluent-RS](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent-rs) library. The Fluent-RS maintainers acknowledge that the core has little in the way of ergonomics, and they have two different libraries that they are developing to provide those. No ergonomics library is mature at this time, and this one follows just my own pattens of use which may not be suitable for all users.

I do expect to deprecate this eventually.
